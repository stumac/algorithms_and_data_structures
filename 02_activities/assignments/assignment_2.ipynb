    "To be honest, these questions were fun to re-discover. I remember taking these courses over a decade ago, and found them quite annoying. Now though, they were significantly easier to reason about. That said, my biggest issue was the ambiquity of these questions, both for mine, and my partners questions. Using my experience as an example, the examples do not at all line up with the problem set. This led to confusion on my end, and what I can only assume is confusion on my partner's critique. Additionally, the fact that my partner had to create their own factory for a binary search tree is a bit problematic (in my opinion). If these questions are to be compared to leetcode, which they clearly are, then I'd argue that both the example sets, and the constructors _must_ be accurate and provided for. I've never been asked to create the data structure before working on it in an interview, and i've interviewed quite a fair bit.Overall though, I must stress again that this was englightening, and I had fun for the first time in a while. In the future, I'd like to see more functional aspects considered when working on these assignments, but that's a problem for future me. I could've been more functional, but I chose not to be (most likely because python isn't terribly functional)"
